        <h3>Directions to make yummy japanese curry</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by washing your white rice grains a few times in water until the water becomes clear. Place your rice pot into the rice cooker.</li>
                <li>While the rice is cooking, it is time to prep the veggies. Wash your vegetables, cut your potatoes and carrots into small bite size pieces. Slice your onion into medium slices.</li>
                <li>Drizzle your olive oil into a pot over a medium flame. Add in your beef cubes into the pan. Once the beef has browned up slightly, add in your veggies and sautee them until the onions become translucent.</li>
                <li>Add in a pinch of salt, afterwards pour 450ml of water into the pot. Let it start to boil.</li>
                <li>Once it starts boiling, add in your 4 japanese curry cubes. Mix the pot occasionally for 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Allow the heat to go to a simmer, add in 2tbsp of ketchup and soysauce.</li>
                <li>Mix and salt to taste. Place your freshly cooked rice onto a plate, and scoop your readily made japanese curry on the side.</li>
